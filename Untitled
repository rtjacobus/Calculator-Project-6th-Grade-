this is the project my group and i have been working on.
it does not look like much, in fact it is only a simple calculater.
it took alot of coding to do this.
you are probably thinking "that looks easy i could do it with my eyes shut."
well not as easy as you think.
i am about to show you all of the code it took to write this "simple calculater".


project by Ryan Jacobus, Wesly Booner, and Matt Deshamp.
